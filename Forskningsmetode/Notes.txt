    - There are two metrics of success for this project. One is that the system is easy and enjoyable enough that users will use it. The other is that the quality of the data is such that it can be used to construct ontologies, and to be shared proudly.
        - These can correspond to the two dual goals of Design Science \citet{Sein2011}, namely to help build theory and to solve problems.
