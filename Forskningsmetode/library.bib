abstract = {Recent work in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is exploring the use of formal ontologies as a way of specifying content-specific agreements for the sharing and reuse of knowledge among software entities. We take an engineering perspective on the development of such ontologies. Formal ontologies are viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for specific purposes and evaluated against objective design criteria. We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices are evaluated against the design criteria. (C) 1995 Academic Press Limited},

Here we present a prototype that allows users to annotate content within digital libraries; the annotation schema is built upon the Annotation Ontology; data is available as RDF, making it possible to publish it as linked data and use SPARQL and SWRL for querying, reasoning, and processing. Our demo illustrates how a social tagging system could be used within the context of digital libraries in life sciences so that users are able to better organize, share, and discover knowledge embedded in research articles.

@article{Gregor2007,
abstract = {Design work and design knowledge in Information Systems ( IS) is important for both research and practice. Yet there has been comparatively little critical attention paid to the problem of specifying design theory so that it can be communicated, justified, and developed cumulatively. In this essay we focus on the structural components or anatomy of design theories in IS as a special class of theory. In doing so, we aim to extend the work of Walls, Widemeyer and El Sawy ( 1992) on the specification of information systems design theories (ISDT), drawing on other streams of thought on design research and theory to provide a basis for a more systematic and useable formulation of these theories. We identify eight separate components of design theories: ( 1) purpose and scope, ( 2) constructs, ( 3) principles of form and function, ( 4) artifact mutability, ( 5) testable propositions, ( 6) justificatory knowledge ( kernel theories), ( 7) principles of implementation, and ( 8) an expository instantiation. This specification includes components missing in the Walls et al. adaptation of Dubin ( 1978) and Simon ( 1969) and also addresses explicitly problems associated with the role of instantiations and the specification of design theories for methodologies and interventions as well as for products and applications. The essay is significant as the unambiguous establishment of design knowledge as theory gives a sounder base for arguments for the rigor and legitimacy of IS as an applied discipline and for its continuing progress. A craft can proceed with the copying of one example of a design artifact by one artisan after another. A discipline cannot.},

abstract = {Abstract. WordNet is an electronic lexical database structured around psychological and linguistic principles. As such, it should play a part in any effort to integrate cognitive factors into knowledge based systems. Yet, some of its basic assumptions have been attacked, and the sug- gestion made that a major restructuring would make it more cognitively transparent. We investigate these allegations from a psycholinguistic perspective and conclude that WordNet is in fact rigorous in terms of the cognitive principles it embodies. What is lacking is a methodology for translating the explicit and implicit knowledge in WordNet into a usable, formal ontologies. We show some ways in which WordNet should be ex- tended to facilitate this process. We agree that WordNet is not in itself ready for use as a formal ontology, but we argue that it is an invaluable tool for describing the conceptualized structure of our world, and should be used as a fundamental resource.},

@article{Damme2007,
abstract = {We can observe that the amount of non-toy domain ontologies is still very limited for many areas of interest. In contrast, folksonomies are widely in use for (1) tagging Web pages (e.g. del.icio.us), (2) annotating pictures (e.g. flickr), or (3) classifying scholarly publications (e.g. bibsonomy). However, such folksonomies cannot offer the expressivity of ontologies, and the respective tags often lack a context-independent and intersubjective definition of meaning. Also, folksonomies and other unsupervised vocabularies frequently suffer from inconsistencies and redundancies. In this paper, we argue that the social interaction manifested in folksonomies and in their usage should be exploited for building and maintaining ontologies. Then, we sketch a comprehensive approach for deriving ontologies from folksonomies by integrating multiple resources and techniques. In detail, we suggest combining (1) the statistical analysis of folksonomies, associated usage data, and their implicit social networks, (2) online lexical resources like dictionaries, Wordnet, Google and Wikipedia, (3) ontologies and Semantic Web resources, (4) ontology mapping and matching approaches, and (5) functionality that helps human actors in achieving and maintaining consensus over ontology element suggestions resulting from the preceding steps.},
